## AI Proofreader

[openai-proof-reader.py](need-help/openai-proof-reader.py) isn't working. Can anyone help me with it? It sends the request but then hangs. 

UPDATE 2023-12-19: This latest update works with a significantly shortened input file. For now I'm assuming the program works okay, within filesize limitations.

This program was adapted from the code shown at https://codecurrents.blog/article/2023-07-16.
